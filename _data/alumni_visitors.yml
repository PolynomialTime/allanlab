  bio: Sajjad Hassanpour is a Ph.D. student in Construction Engineering at the University of Auckland. He received a bachelor's degree in civil engineering at Iran University of Science and Technology in 2010, and his M.Sc. degree in transportation planning-at the Trabiat Modares University of Iran in 2012. During his Ph.D. in transportation planning, as he was interested in computer science, he started working on agent-based modeling and computer-based simulation models. Therefore, he started a new Ph.D. at the University of Auckland, focusing on agent-based building earthquake evacuation simulation. He is interested in pedestrian dynamics, multiagent systems, and machine learning.
