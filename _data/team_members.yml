  bio: Jiamou Liu is a Senior Lecturer at the School of Computer Science, The University of Auckland. He was a Senior Lecturer at Auckland University of Technology between 2011 and 2015. Jiamou obtained a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Auckland, and worked as a research associate in University of Leipzig between 2009 and 2010 and Paris Diderot University (Paris 7) in 2013. He was a research intern at Microsoft Research Asia in 2008. During his PhD, he was a visiting student at Cornell University and National University of Singapore. Originally trained as a theoretical computer scientist, Jiamou's current research is in Artificial Intelligence. He is interested in both the theoretical and the applied aspects of artificial intelligence. In particular, his work revolves around the structural analysis and algorithmic studies of social networks, multiagent systems, machine learning, as well as natural language processing. His recent research also connects to health-care, real estate data mining, data privacy, computational social science, and spatial-temporal data analysis with application in traffic flow prediction.
