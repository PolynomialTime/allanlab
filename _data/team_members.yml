  bio: My research interests lie in the intersection between theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. Recently my research mainly focuses on the interdisciplinary area of computational social science and multi-agent systems. My main research activities involve exploring social networks; topics of interests include interpersonal ties, influence, communities structures, information diffusion and social cohesion. I am also interested in pure and applied aspects of logic, algorithmic model theory, computational complexity and automata theory.
