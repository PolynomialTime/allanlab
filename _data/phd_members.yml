  info: My research interests lie in the intersection between natural language processing and question answering. Recently my research mainly focuses on machine reasoning. My main research activities involve natural language understanding; topics of interest include problem decomposition, knowledge acquisition, explanation, entailment and generate QA. I am also interested in the graph-based neural network.
