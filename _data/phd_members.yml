  bio: I received my First Class Honours degree in computer science from the University of Auckland in 2018, and my B.S. in computer science from Beijing Institute of Technology in 2017. My main research interest lies in reinforcement learning in structured and non-structured multi-agent systems. I aim to solve issues modeled as multi-agent systems from the learning and game-theoretical perspective. Along this line, my ultimate goal is to reinforce insights into rules of applying machine learning techniques in conjunction with game theory. Very recently, my focus moves to reinforcement learning in games with tons of agents.

  bio: Sajjad Hassanpour is a Ph.D. student in Construction Engineering at the University of Auckland. He received a bachelor's degree in civil engineering at Iran University of Science and Technology in 2010, and his M.Sc. degree in transportation planning-at the Trabiat Modares University of Iran in 2012. During his Ph.D. in transportation planning, as he was interested in computer science, he started working on agent-based modeling and computer-based simulation models. Therefore, he started a new Ph.D. at the University of Auckland, focusing on agent-based building earthquake evacuation simulation. He is interested in pedestrian dynamics, multiagent systems, and machine learning.
